real-time evaluation is for name, on line 143

conditional error is for email, starting on line 181. If blank gives 'email should not be blank'
if formatted incorrectly gives 'Email requires an @ sign and a .com suffix'

I made cc month and year required, as there's an border-error class available (though it doesn't seem required to do so?).

I have a long if chain starting on 231, would it be preferable to use switch instead?
